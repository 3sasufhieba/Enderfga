Here are some more paragraphs about Autodesk Vehicle Tracking 2019:
 
One of the main features of Autodesk Vehicle Tracking 2019 is the swept path analysis. This feature allows you to analyze and predict the movement of steered vehicles, light rail vehicles, and aircraft in different scenarios. You can use predefined or custom vehicle types, specify speed and turning parameters, and generate 2D or 3D animations of the vehicle paths. You can also check for clearance and conflicts with other objects in your design.
 
Another feature of Autodesk Vehicle Tracking 2019 is the parking lot design. This feature allows you to use geometric rules for more efficient layout of parking rows and bays. You can choose from different parking standards, adjust the dimensions and angles of the parking spaces, and create custom parking shapes. You can also calculate the parking capacity and occupancy, and generate reports and tables.
 
A third feature of Autodesk Vehicle Tracking 2019 is the roundabout design. This feature allows you to quickly generate roundabout designs that blend with existing or planned roads. You can use predefined or custom roundabout templates, modify the geometry and alignment of the roundabout elements, and apply design standards and criteria. You can also analyze the traffic flow and capacity, and create reports and diagrams.
