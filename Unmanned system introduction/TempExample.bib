 abstract={Two new features have been added to the eighth edition to complement the book's strong integration of design and analysis. The Sequential Design Problem feature, using a disk drive as the example, highlights the main themes in each chapter and how they impact the design of a control system. A Continuous Design Problem is included at the end of each problem set to give students an opportunity to model, analyze, and design various types of controllers for a table-top machine tool as they proceed through the chapters. The textbook provides a clear exposition of the basic principles of control system design techniques using frequency- and time-domain methods as well as the state variable method.},
